## Project Description 👩‍🏫
The Marketing Campaigns Analysis project aims to leverage exploratory data analysis (EDA) and 
hypothesis testing techniques to gain a comprehensive understanding of the factors that influence customer acquisition. 
The goal is to analyze marketing campaign data and extract valuable insights that can inform future marketing strategies.

## Tasks
The project goal will be achieved by going through the following steps:

1. Data Wrangling
- Ensure that the data is clean and that there is no missing or incorrect data.
- Use ordinal encoding and one hot encoding according to different types of categorical variables.
2. Data Analysis 
-	Older people are not as tech-savvy and probably prefer shopping in-store.
-	Customers with kids probably have less time to visit a store and would prefer to shop online.
-	Other distribution channels may cannibalize sales at the store.
-	Does the US fare significantly better than the rest of the world in terms of total purchases?
3. Data Visualization
- Which products are performing the best, and which are performing the least in terms of revenue?
-	Is there any pattern between the age of customers and the last campaign acceptance rate?
-	Which Country has the greatest number of customers who accepted the last campaign?
-	Do you see any pattern in the no. of children at home and total spend?
-	Education background of the customers who complained in the last 2 years.
